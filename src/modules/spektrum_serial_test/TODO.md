#TODO
##FIXME Put total msg length at front of packet!!!

##Send thrust controller inputs with vision pose
So that pilot can control z position

##Set setpoint difference limit
So that we can effectively attenuate signals

##Add heuristic so that vision pose sent doesn't
##jump suddenly

##Update PX4 estimator coordinate orientation to
##send with the same orientation as VISlam

##Check VISlam orientation vs PX4 orientation

##Check VISlam position vs PX4 estimator position
