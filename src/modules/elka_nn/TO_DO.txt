TO DO

look into simulation eric sent you on fb
	dont have to setup snap dragon if you can get this working

	install ros
	verify ros
	install simulation
	verify simulation
	set up simulated drone in simulation with flight path
	maybe even with the flight controller we're using
	connect simulation to genann to get data into genann
	import data on time steps such that the data is fed
	from the simulation into genann in real time
